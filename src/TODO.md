So, I talked to my dad a little while ago (he does web dev stuff) about some of my visions for the website here (blog section, being able to easily update it, color palatte changes, etc.) and he sugested that we have some sort of database. Now I have no idea where to start with that, but I did figure out something
Specifically involving the blog section. Now my vision isn't very clear, but what I know is that I want a way to be able to easily update it for anyone to see, without having to create a brand new html file and format it and all that every time we want to upload to the blog. So I pondered for a bit, and remembered forums. If you've ever used any forums ever, you've probaby noticed that whenever you want to create a post or a thread or something, you've seen all these buttons at the bottom, or guidelines with a bunch of syntax. And bigger threads with lots of neat styling and formatting. I thought that maybe we could make a system reminiscent of these forums formatters for the purpose of streamlining the creation of blog posts, maybe not just for us, but for other branches of the cs club, like girls who code and the esports club (if it comes to it ever.)
Particularly, a system where we could upload a .txt file with a blog post, formatted using one of these already existing systems, and then have a converter through javascript turn it into html & css for the public eye.
Lmk what you think
